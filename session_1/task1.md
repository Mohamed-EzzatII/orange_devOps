## üñ•Ô∏è Web Server Overview

A web server is essential for hosting websites and delivering content to users across the internet. It encompasses both:

- **Hardware**: The physical server machine.
- **Software**: The program responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving content.

### Key Functions:
- **Handling HTTP Requests**: Processes requests from users' browsers.
- **Serving Content**: Provides static files (e.g., HTML, CSS) and dynamic content (e.g., content generated by scripts).

### Common Web Servers:
- **Apache**: Widely used, known for its flexibility and extensive module support.
- **Nginx**: Renowned for high performance and efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections.
- **Microsoft IIS**: A web server for Windows environments.

## üåê Accessing Websites on a Web Server

To access a website hosted on a web server, follow these steps:

1. **Send an HTTP Request**:
   - **IP Address**: `http://192.168.1.1`
   - **Domain Name**: `http://www.example.com`

2. **Port Numbers**:
   - **Default Ports**:
     - HTTP: `80`
     - HTTPS: `443`
   - **Custom Ports**:
     - For sites running on non-default ports, specify the port in the URL: `http://www.example.com:8080`.

3. **Multiple Web Servers**:
   - When multiple servers are hosted on the same IP, differentiate them by using different port numbers in the URL:
     - `http://192.168.1.1:8080`
     - `http://192.168.1.1:8081`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Apache vs. Nginx

### **Apache**
- **Architecture**: Process-driven.
- **Suitability**: Ideal for dynamic content.
- **Customization**: Highly customizable with support for `.htaccess` files.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in shared hosting environments.

### **Nginx**
- **Architecture**: Event-driven.
- **Suitability**: Excels in handling high concurrency and static content.
- **Configuration**: Simple and concise.
- **Usage**: Often employed as a reverse proxy or load balancer.
